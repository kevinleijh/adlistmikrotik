This is a script that fetch an adlist from github and then remove the domains that are in the whitelist.txt.

The link for the adlist which you can use in your mikrotik is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kevinleijh/adlistmikrotik/refs/heads/main/adlist.txt

I added whitelist for google.com so that I can access Google Analytics
